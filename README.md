## Tool Description
Automation of object detection and facial detection for export in images or in text/json format. We look to open up analysis of images and make it easier to run on a desktop and using opencv and other tools. With this, researchers can get a list of objects recognized by libraries like opencv or tensorflow models and edit, walk through a recording to see objects at a certain time and export found objects into a picture folder or json list with coordinates per frame. This is 
focused on desktop recording or video recording. 

At its current stage, the tool is using OpenCV for facial detection and for shape detection up to 8 sides. There is more refining needing to be done. It is also Windows only.

We hope to expand adding in machine learning for better object detection and facial recognition along with tagging information. We hope to also open up the ability to add your own tensorflow models and build in plugins using C++.

For the non-technical researcher, we hope to cut through the task of labeling or watching for details with a strained eye and missing the whole picture.
